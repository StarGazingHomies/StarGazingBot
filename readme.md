# StarGazingBot

This bot started as, and still is, a project that is worked on for fun and in my free time.
Please do not expect regular updates.

Modules will be added and updated based on my current interests.

## Starting the bot

To initialize the bot, run the init.bat script in the root directory.
Then, you can run main.py whenever you want to run the bot.

## Current Modules
 - General commands (settings, report, etc.)
 - Hypixel Skyblock
 - Manebooru
